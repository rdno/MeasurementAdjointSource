(1) comment out line 882-885 in /src/pyadjoint/adjoint_source_types/multitaper_misfit.py to not 
taper the adjoint source in time domain like in line 618-621 (set fac = 1.0) in original 
ma_sub.f90


CHANGES
Ridvan Orsvuran, 2016

(1) instead of using forcing measure_adj to use ntaper-3. I disabled
the taper rejection by pyadjoint using the setting low_bias=False.

Patch used in pyadjoint can be seen in the file pyadjoint.patch.

(2) pytomo3d no longer has postprocess_adjsrc metho. So It has commented out.

(3) frequency range and mt_nw values are changed. However, they have
no effect on the result.

(4) I added a couple of sac file outputs to pyadjoint and measure_adj.

   - data.sac & syn.sac: These are the windowed and tapered
     datas. There is slight difference between the implementation of
     "cos_p10" taper. It can be seen plotting the data versus
     "../adjsrc_fortran/OUTPUT_FILES/AFI.IU.BHZ.01.mtm.obs.sac" and
     "../adjsrc_fortran/OUTPUT_FILES/AFI.IU.BHZ.01.mtm.syn.sac". Using
     the fortran version in python did not change the result of the
     final comparison.

   - measure_adj calculates cc_shift as -4. pyadjoint calculates it -5.
   This can be seen by plotting data.recon.sac (shifted obsd data) vs
   "../adjsrc_fortran/OUTPUT_FILES/AFI.IU.BHZ.01.mtm.recon_dat_cc.sac"


(5) changing window borders of pyadjoint from [[816, 1067]] to [[816, 1066]]
results in match between measure_adj and pyadjoint. Even though their
window sizes are different.
